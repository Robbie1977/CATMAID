  <h4>How to...</h4><p><em>Hide edges/links:</em>
  Select an edge and use the <em>Hide</em> button in the
  <em>Selection</em> tab.</p>
  <h4>Export Graphs for layouting in other tools</h4>
  <p>For some graphs, layouting is easier done in other tools, e.g.
  Gephi. Since the coloring is likely easier to do in CATMAID, a
  re-import is useful as well. This workflow can be done in CATMAID
  like the following:<p>
  <ol><li>Export a graph as GML, the default export options (linearize
  IDs) are fine.</li>
  <li>Open GML file in Gephi and do layout.</li>
  <li>Export graph in Gephi as GraphML file: File > Export > Graph
  file. Choose "GraphML" as file type in file dialog.</li>
  <li>In CATMAID, click "Openâ€¦" in the Graph Widget\'s main tab and
  select the exported GraphML (ends on .graphml).</li>
  <li>The default options in the import dialog should work for
  Gephi. Preferring the unit_id and name fields assumes a previous
  CATMAID export of the graph.</li></ol>
  <p>This should open the Graph with Gephi\'s layout</p>
